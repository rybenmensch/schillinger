#Schillinger Max Package

Hochschule der Künste Bern - 2020

##About
The Schillinger Max Package is an ongoing effort to implement rhythmical concepts developed by Joseph Schillinger in the first half of the 20th century. The initial development was done as part of my bachelor thesis, BA Sound Arts, Hochschule der Künste Bern, 2020. The thesis, along with additional example patches, mapping the progress of implementation can be downloaded here (all in German):

##Compatibility
This package depends on multichannel capabilities and thus is compatible only with Max 8 onwards.

As of right now, there are no Windows binaries, as I don't have a Windows developement environment. If you would want to compile the externals for Windows, feel free to do so, and message me so that they can be added to the official release of the package.
##Installation
To install this package, simply move this whole folder to your 'Packages' Folder, normally found at ~/Documents/Max 8.

To remove this package, just delete it from the 'Packages' folder.
##Contact
If you find any bugs, have suggestions for improvement or any questions, feel free to contact me at manolo.mueller@gmail.com.
